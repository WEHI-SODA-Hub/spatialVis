\usage{
summarise_segmentation_stats(
  measurement_data,
  compartments = c("Cell", "Nucleus"),
  compartment_measurements = c("Area", "Length", "Circularity", "Solidity",
    "Max diameter", "Min diameter"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{compartments}{Character vector of compartments to summarise (default:
c("Cell", "Nucleus"))}

\item{compartment_measurements}{Character vector of measurements to summarise
for each compartment (default: c("Area", "Length", "Circularity", "Solidity",
"Max diameter", "Min diameter"))}

\item{other_measurements}{Character vector of additional measurements to
summarise (default: c("Nucleus/Cell area ratio"))}

\item{summary_funcs}{List of functions to summarise the measurements
(default: list(Mean = mean, Median = median))}

\item{geojson_file}{Path to the GeoJSON file containing segmentation data}
}
\value{
A data.frame object
}
\description{
Take segmentation measurements and summarise statistics,
returning an output table. If measurements are not available, the function
will return only the cell counts.
